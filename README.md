# SafeARCross

SafeARCross is an AR application designed for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 aimed to improve awareness in pedestrian crossing scenarios using two systems, (1) a collision warning system, and (2) virtual traffic lights. Our analysis of this system showed that there was statistical evidence suggesting significant improvements in perceived workload, perceived safety, and a reduction in the number of head movements for these systems when compared to scenarios without AR assistance, concluding that the users trusted
the AR systems. Furthermore, participants rated the systems as excellent in terms of usability.

The Collision Warning System AR interface is designed to alert the user through a multi-modal warning system, that is activated when it receives a new DENM via MQTT, immediately alerting the user with: (1) a visual notification within the user’s center of view prompting to halt; (2) a 3D arrow pointing to the direction of the hazard; (3) and an 800 Hz tone lasting one second. As DENMs are continuously being transmitted during hazardous events, the visual alert remains active, only disappearing when a new message has not been received for more than one second.

## Getting started
The project contains the binary .sln file ([SafeARCross.sln](https://github.com/nap-it/SafeARCross/blob/main/SafeARCross.sln)) ready to be deployed on the Microsoft HoloLens 2 using Visual Studio 2019. Follow the Microsoft [guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-visual-studio?tabs=hl2) to deploy and debug using Visual Studio.
