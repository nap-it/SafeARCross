"Colors in the semaphore should be more intense, allowing for better visibility"
The semaphore was a bit hard to see with the sunlight but the audio cue helped bringing attention to the change in the light
"I am concerned on what would the scenario be in a road with multiple vehicles, I might see a car cross and think that the dangerous situation is over but the warning is still active because there is another car coming that I might not see. Someone might interpert a scenario of continuous warning as a ""bugged warning"" and disregard the inidications. It would be interesting to see a number indicating the number of vehicles in the dangerous situation or something as a double warning when another vehicle enters the scene"
The arrow pointing to the incoming car helped a lot understanding the dangerous situation
Using the AR Headset made it more difficult to move my head to look before crossing
